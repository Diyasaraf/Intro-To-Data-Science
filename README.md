Some Basic Operations: The provided code involves matrix multiplication, z-score normalization, sigmoid function implementation and its derivative and pandas data manipulationg. Specifically, it checks the validity of matrix multiplication, performs multiplication using loops and numpy, applies z-score normalization with and without numpy, implements the sigmoid function and its derivative and finally, reads and manipulates data using pandas.

Linear Regression:  Training a linear regression model with stochastic gradient descent. The trained model parameters approximate the expected values, indicating successful implementation.

KNN using python: The Python script uses Pandas to load the Iris dataset, visualizes it with scatter plots, and splits it into training and testing sets. It then implements k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification from scratch, plotting accuracy against varying k values. Additionally, scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier is employed for comparison, with accuracy plotted similarly.
